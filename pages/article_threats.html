							<h3>What Threatens the Inlet</h3>

							<p>The ecology of Pāuatahanui Inlet is under threat from three primary sources - sedimentation, contamination and eutrophication (the increasing concentration of plant nutrients in a body of water). A fourth threat may yet come from local effects of climate change, which could include a rise in sea level, more rainfall and increasingly frequent storms.</p>

							<p>A lot of the problems affecting the Inlet are due to the urbanisation of the southern and western end of the Inlet. GOPI is pleased to note that PCC, in its 30-year vision document the <a href="https://poriruacity.govt.nz/Publications/Porirua-Development-Framework/" target="_blank">Porirua Development Framework,</a> does not envision further large scale urban development of the Pāuatahanui Inlet basin, although some light industrial development may occur as a consequence of the building of the Transmission Gully Motorway.</p>

							<h3>Sedimentation</h3>

							<p>The infilling of estuaries with sediment derived from erosion of catchment land is a natural process but the rate at which it occurs in the Inlet has been radically increased by human activity. Recent research shows that, before humans arrived in the area, sediment accumulated in the Inlet at a rate of about 1 mm/year. The rate more than doubled during 1850-1950 as the forested land was converted to pasture.  During 1950-1985, a period when earthworks associated with urban development were ineffectively controlled, the rate at least trebled but a <a href="https://poriruacity.govt.nz/DownloadFile/Publications/Harbour-Management/Porirua-Harbour-Bathymetric-Survey-2015/" target="_blank">recent bathymetric survey (2014)</a> estimates that during 1974-2009 the rate was between 3 and 9mm/yr in different parts of the Inlet. It is highly probable this was largely caused by the building of Mana marina and the consequent transport of displaced sand into the Inlet. Its greatest effect was an increase in the size and location of the central sand bank, which has reduced the flushing by the outgoing tide of fine sediment from the north-western part of the Inlet. Thankfully the 2014  survey concluded that the current rate has now dropped to about 2mm/yr, though part of this decline undoubtedly is due to the lack of severe storms in recent years.</p>

							<p>As sediment builds up, the intertidal and salt marsh areas increase slowly and the deeper parts of the Inlet become shallower. Of more immediate concern for Inlet ecology is that the increased amount of sediment in the water reduces its clarity and the ability of seagrass and algae to photosynthesise and grow. Increased sediment also reduces the feeding efficiency of cockles and other filter-feeding animals and lays down more mud on the surface of the sand. From a human perspective there is a general shift towards an increase in less desirable species, such as mud snails, and a less visually attractive aspect at low tide – and one that may smell a bit too.</p>
